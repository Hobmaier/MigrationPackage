# MigrationPackage
Code example on how to Use SPOMigrationPackage to migrate filesystem or SharePoint on-prem into SharePoint Online

I've recently added Start-SPOMigration.ps1 which contains all steps ready to go for using fileshare as a source. Please take care, that there are slight differences when using SharePoint on-prem as a source.
